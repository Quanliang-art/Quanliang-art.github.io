									<p>The Fausto Llerena Tortoise Center on Santa Cruz was started in 1965 to save the tortoise population on Pinzón Island. At the time, the Pinzón tortoise population consisted of fewer than 200 old adults and no juveniles. Throughout the 20th century, all hatchlings had apparently been killed by black rats, which were accidentally introduced to the island in the late 1800s. Without help, this population would eventually disappear.</p>
									<p>On Española Island, only 14 tortoises remained (2 males and 12 females). These were brought into captivity and a tortoise breeding program began. A third Española male was returned to Galapagos in 1976 from the San Diego Zoo.</p>
									<p>In addition to Pinzón and Española, juvenile tortoises reared in captivity for eventual release back into the wild come from Santa Cruz and Santiago Islands. Tortoise eggs and/or hatchlings are collected from natural nests of these Critically Endangered species and brought to the Center.</p>
									<p>Since 2015, the juvenile Española tortoises born in captivity have been released onto Santa Fe to contribute to the island’s ecological restoration.</p>
									<p>A breeding program to restore tortoises to Floreana Island, where the native tortoise species went extinct in the 1800s, began in 2017.On Santa Cruz Island, a comprehensive and extremely successful Galapagos Giant Tortoise Restoration project has been ongoing for several decades. This past year has witnessed major advancements in the project because of modern technologies and the efforts of the Galapagos National Park Rangers.Due to several factors, including the complete eradication of feral goats, the improvement of nesting areas, the significant decrease in introduced rats, and the restoration of their natural habitats, Galapagos giant tortoises today have a far higher chance of survival than they did fifty years ago. Their hatching success rate in the wild is no higher than 10%, and even in the absence of predators, their reproduction is still vulnerable due to the ongoing presence of introduced animals.</p>
									<p>Therefore, the park’s main focus this year is the Galapagos Giant Tortoise Restoration Initiative and the development of techniques to safeguard tortoise nests in significant breeding sites. As of October of this year, 313 turtle nests had been protected thanks to the efforts of park rangers in the Galapagos National Park. By building a mesh fence around the nest, these rangers hope to protect it from predators like wild pigs. They aim to use a global positioning system (GPS) to identify as many nests as possible rigorously.Apart from the Galapagos Giant Tortoise Restoration Initiative, further efforts were made to facilitate the tortoises’ productive procreation. Control measures were put in place to combat invasive species like ants, which have the potential to seriously damage eggs. Additionally, in order to support the baby tortoises that the park will release in December, rangers have been mowing access trails. Earlier this year, some eggs were taken out of nests and given to the captive breeding program on Santa Cruz, where the hatching success rate is approximately 75%. The hatching season for several species of tortoises is rapidly approaching, which makes our effort incredibly crucial.</p>
