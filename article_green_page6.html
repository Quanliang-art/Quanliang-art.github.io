										The Galapagos National Park Directorate, in partnership with Galapagos Conservancy, successfully repatriated 136 juvenile tortoises to the Cinco Cerros area on Isabela Island’s Cerro Azul volcano. These brave tortoises, aged between 5 and 9 years, were returned to their natural habitat, the only place where populations from Sierra Negra and Cerro Azul volcanoes coexist.The Galapagos National Park Directorate, in partnership with Galapagos Conservancy, successfully repatriated 136 juvenile tortoises to the Cinco Cerros area on Isabela Island’s Cerro Azul volcano. These brave tortoises, aged between 5 and 9 years, were returned to their natural habitat, the only place where populations from Sierra Negra and Cerro Azul volcanoes coexist.The financial support provided by passionate advocates of conservation made it possible to safely move these tortoises via helicopter, which is a crucial tool that has enhanced our transport capacity for this species. Without the helicopter support, the only alternative would be to transport them by sea and then carry them on shoulders across several kilometers of lava fields and challenging terrain. This would be an immensely challenging task that would take a long time and multiple expeditions. The contributions, like yours, that funded this means of transportation have played a crucial role in overcoming these challenges, ensuring the ongoing success of our conservation initiative.

										The repatriation of tortoises to Isabela Island plays a crucial part in restoring the ecological balance. Tortoises are primary herbivores that actively participate in shaping the landscape and dispersing seeds. These are crucial factors in maintaining ecosystem stability. Dr. Jorge Carrión, our Director of Conservation, emphasized that “we need to remain vigilant because this species is under threat from invasive species. Therefore, we will continue to closely monitor the situation”.The successful repatriation of this new group of 136 juvenile turtles to their home in Isabela marks a crucial milestone in our conservation mission in Galápagos. The collaboration between the Galápagos National Park Directorate and Galápagos Conservancy, supported by our donors’ generosity, has played a crucial role in overcoming logistical challenges and ensuring the safe transportation of these valuable species by helicopter.
									</p>
									<p>
										This accomplishment highlights the significance of being vigilant towards any threats to biodiversity. We would like to express our gratitude towards all the passionate supporters of conservation who have actively contributed to this campaign. Your ongoing commitment and financial support are essential in creating a secure and well-balanced future for the giant tortoises, which are endemic species in Galápagos.
