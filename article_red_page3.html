										Vessels came to the islands to gather the tortoises for food. Sailors believed that tortoises could live up to eighteen months without food and water, thus providing a continuous source of fresh meat. Darwin found the meat “indifferent” to his taste, except “young tortoises [which] make excellent soup.” However, David Porter, who visited the Galápagos twenty-two years before Darwin, in 1813, strongly disagrees:
									</p>
									<p>
										“[H]ideous and disgusting as is their appearance, no animal can possibly afford a more wholesome, luscious, and delicate food than they do; the finest green turtle is no more to be compared to them, in point of excellence, than the coarsest beef is to the finest veal; and after once tasting the Galápagos tortoises, every other animal food fell greatly in our estimation.”
									</p>
									<p>
										Fresh meat of any kind was indeed a wondrous change for sailors restricted to a diet of salt meat. It is hard to imagine how unpalatable and disgusting salt meat truly was. Beef and pork—and occasionally horse—were chopped up, with no attempt to separate the bones and fat, and then thrown into wooden casks of salt brine where the meat would turn green with age.
									</p>
									<p>
										Tortoise hunting was brutal work because of the sharp lava over which the men had to walk, carrying animals weighing hundreds of pounds. The sailors first turned the tortoises on their backs, then placed a large stone on their shells to keep them from drawing in their legs. They then bound the legs of the tortoises with strips of canvas and slung them on their backs. The average weight was about eighty pounds, but it could be much more. According to Thomas Nickerson aboard the whaleship Essex: “[The tortoises’] constant uneasiness whilst carrying them . . . [and] the very uneven walking and constant giving way of stones beneath one’s feet makes it[,] I have often thought[,] the hardest labour that can be given to man.” The number of tortoises captured by visiting vessels, especially whaleships, is astounding. Von Hagen writes: “We have estimated that whalers alone, in a period of seventy-five years, removed more than 250,000.” Further research confirms his estimate.
									</p>
									<p>
										In Journal of a Cruise, Porter tells of sending a crew ashore for approximately five days in 1813, during which “they succeeded in getting on board between four and five hundred” tortoises. When the whaleship Essex visited in 1820, the crew collected a hundred and eighty tortoises on Hood Island in four days. Then, on Charles Island, they collected another hundred tortoises, including a six-hundred-pounder that took six men to carry. Between October 13, 1832, and August 30, 1833, thirty-one whaleships called at Charles Island. If each took two hundred tortoises, that would be six thousand in less than a year.
									</p>
									<p>
										By the time Charles Darwin arrived in 1835, the number of tortoises was greatly diminished. “Their numbers have of course been greatly reduced,” he writes. “It is said that formerly single vessels have taken away as many as seven hundred, and that the ship’s company of a frigate some years since brought down in one day two hundred tortoises to the beach.”
									</p>
									<p>
										When the Acushnet visited the Galápagos on her second voyage in June of 1847, tortoises were very scarce. A group of sailors sent ashore for two and a half days found only sixteen. “Sunday 20th [June 1847]: At Meridian came to anchor at a bay under the lee of Chatham Island[,] one bay to the westward of Stephens Bay[.] Two boats went [to] . . . the E[ast]ward to look for Terrapin[.] Capt wen[t] to Wrack Bay[,] bought Some. . . . Wednesday the boats having arrived the night before with 16 Terrapin . . . Thursday went round to Stephens Bay for terrapin which we had bought.”
									</p>
									<p>
										Charles H. Townsend searched the logbooks of whaleships and found that in the thirty-seven years between 1831 and 1868, seventy-nine vessels visited the Galápagos and carried off 13,013 tortoises. From this study and further research has come the estimate of a hundred to three hundred thousand taken. Had travel to the Galápagos been less arduous, the supply of tortoises would hardly have lasted. Remarkably, eleven of the fifteen subspecies of Galápagos tortoise still survive, despite the onslaught of the whalers.
