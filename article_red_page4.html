										A consequence of over 400 years of human exploitation of Galápagos tortoises (Chelonoidis niger ssp.) is the extinction of several subspecies and the decimation of others. As humans captured, killed, and/or removed tortoises for food, oil, museums, and zoos, they also colonized the archipelago resulting in the introduction of invasive plants, animals, and manipulated landscapes for farming, ranching, and infrastructure. Given current conservation and revitalization efforts for tortoises and their habitats, here we investigate nineteenth and twentieth century Galápagos tortoise dietary ecology using museum and archaeological specimens coupled with analysis of carbon (δ13Ccollagen and δ13Capatite), nitrogen (δ15N), hydrogen (δD) and oxygen (δ18Oapatite) stable isotopes and radiocarbon dating. We identify that Galápagos tortoise diets vary between and within islands over time, and that long-term anthropogenic impacts influenced change in tortoise stable isotope ecology by using 57 individual tortoises from 10 different subspecies collected between 1833 and 1967—a 134-year period. On lower elevation islands, which are often hotter and drier, tortoises tend to consume more C4 vegetation (cacti and grasses). Our research suggests human exploitation of tortoises and anthropogenic impacts on vegetation contributed to the extinction of the Floreana Island tortoise (C. n. niger) in the 1850s.

										Anthropogenic modification of the Galápagos Islands, including exploitation of Galápagos tortoises (Chelonoidis niger ssp.), began shortly after discovery of the archipelago in 1535. For approximately 400 years, until the establishment of the Galápagos National Park in 1959, human consumption of Galápagos tortoises, both deliberate and inadvertent introduction of exotic plants and animals, human colonization, and habitat modification occurred relatively uninhibited. Pirates and whalers captured and consumed tortoises, while colonists attempted to farm and ranch the islands. Whalers alone killed at a minimum over 10,000 tortoises; estimates suggest approximately 200,000 tortoises died due to human activities. Ultimately, this led to the extinction of at least three subspecies of Galápagos tortoise and the decimation of others8;. At the same time, on many islands in the Galápagos the introduction of rats, dogs, pigs, goats, cattle, and a variety of domesticated agricultural plants and other herbaceous and woody taxa resulted in significant modification of tortoise habitats, loss of native vegetation, competition for food, and the introduced presence of exotic predators. Vegetation regimes that had been present throughout the Holocene disappeared post-colonization as invasive plants flourished. This combination of impacts created simultaneous, long-lasting effects: tortoises died through direct consumption from introduced carnivorous predators (including humans) and through indirect competition and loss of habitats and resources. These changes also affected Galápagos tortoise diets, by increasing competition for resources and shifting the baseline food web towards introduced, non-native plant types. Today, Galápagos tortoise populations and habitats are undergoing long-term rehabilitation with continued efforts towards conservation and native plant restoration.
